## details
I may have got Terry A. Davis' make of minivan incorrect, it's actually very hard to findout these details but based on [this video](https://youtu.be/KqkDilaMW_M?t=133) the car Terry seems to be referring to as "his car" looks like a 2008-2010 Honda Odyssey, the uploader dates the original upload of the video by Terry to be 2017-05-21. This is 63 weeks and 6 days before his ascention on the 11 August 2018.
